Welcome to the grand archive where brave knights and cunning rogues chronicle their exploits in the dark and treacherous lands of Capture The Flag (CTF) dungeons.  

Herein lie scrolls of vanquished vulnerable machines, cunning traps discovered, and secrets plundered from afar. Tread carefully, for every procedure is a relic of past quests—study them well, lest ye awaken the dreaded Segmentation Fault Dragon! 🐉
