#### 005: Importance of tense

Writing everything in present tense (“The tester enumerates…”, “The attacker gains…”) creates a narrative immediacy.
- Reads like a walkthrough or blog post, not an assessment
- Can imply the issue is actively occurring
- Weakens evidentiary clarity in regulated or legal contexts

Present tense is acceptable for education, not professional pentest deliverables.

Writing everything in past tense (“The vulnerability allowed…”, “The application exposed…”) subtly implies remediation may already have occurred.

That ambiguity works against risk communication.
