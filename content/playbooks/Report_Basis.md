#### 001: Retrospective Record (Past Tense)

The past tense is employed exclusively for:

- Actions undertaken during the assessment.
- Observations made at the time of execution.
- Findings derived from those actions.
- Adversarial procedures successfully enacted.

This tense establishes the historical certainty of events and confines them to the period of assessment.

---
#### 002: Declarative Condition (Present Tense)

The present tense is reserved for:

- System properties and configurations.
- Identified vulnerabilities.
- Associated risks.
- Business and technical impact.

This tense affirms that the described conditions exist at the time of reporting, irrespective of when they were discovered.

---
#### 003: Sectional Construction

Each technical section shall be composed in the following order, where applicable:

**Approach**
- A concise description of the method applied and observations, stated without conjecture.

**Finding**
- A factual statement of what was identified or achieved, if any such outcome occurred.

**Execution Evidence**
- Commands or actions executed, presented as historical record rather than guidance.

**Corroborative Material**
- Screenshots demonstrating the stated finding.

Absence of findings shall not necessitate inclusion of all subsections.

---
#### 004: Grammatical Allocation

To preserve consistency and authority, the following allocations apply:

- Section Titles — Present tense
- System Descriptions — Present tense
- Methodological Narration — Past tense
- Evidence and Output — Past tense

This division ensures that conditions are read as enduring, while acts remain confined to the assessment interval.

---
#### 004: Principle of Relevance

The report shall concern itself principally with successful attack paths.
- Unsuccessful or non‑productive avenues are excluded from narration.
- Their execution may be acknowledged only at a methodological level, where necessary to demonstrate scope.

This maintains clarity and avoids dilution of material risk.
